# Do like Countries üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
Simple iOS Project for search on Countries

The project contains 4 modules:
- Core
- Repository
    - Remote Repository
        - HTTPClient
- App

The **Core** is a Domain module that only keeps pure entities and protocols.
The **Repository** acts like a brain that decide how to prepare data for the App module that right now only uses **RemoteRepostirty** module. Still, one of the future tasks is to add **CacheRepository**.

The **App** module is a presentation layer that has **Module** directory. The module here means feature module that any time you want, you can make it a separate module with minimum dependency to other classes or modules. For communicating between modules, use **Router** approach that brings the most of the class or concreates class from [Github Repository](https://github.com/CassiusPacheco/iOS-Routing-Example/tree/part1)
